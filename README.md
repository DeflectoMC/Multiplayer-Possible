# Multiplayer-Possible
A simple demonstration program on doing LAN outside of LAN.

# Downloads

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/DeflectoMC/Multiplayer-Possible/releases/) for downloads.

# Code




Maven/Gradle files have not been added yet; I've compiled this directly in my IDE.

You are free to use this as a reference for how to accomplish this technique on your own.

I will be adding Wiki pages tomorrow, more tutorial videos, etc.

### License


This code is licensed under Apache 2.0 Commons License, but honestly with how short it is, you could probably just copy the *idea* instead of the code; and then you wouldn't have to include a copy of the license would you ðŸ˜‰

# Potentially Huge Benefits:

- Base free servers for everyone

- Less electricity usage ðŸ’šðŸŒŽ due to less computers required for multiplayer, and less packets sent over the internet

- Could be turned into a Fabric mod + Bukkit plugin, automated with a fully working /join command etc. That is my current plan. I already accomplished it too with my previous project using WebRTC, called GameBridge.


- Could be turned into a free server hosting network, by adding a lot more features and making it so players don't have to manually enter the info every time

- Otherwise unrelated projects could still use the same system to accomplish things like voice chatting on any server, without requiring the server to have a plugin installed.

# Notes:

- I have been working on this topic overall for 3 months now. I've had to do it slowly on my own, do my own research, and find the best options available. This is probably the 6th-8th iteration I've done of this idea, and third open sourced. 

- Nobody helped me with coding during that entire time. Please do be respectful in your criticisms, and understand that I do care and am just trying to help bring these major benefits to everyone, and not gatekeep the knowledge to myself. 

- I was told this thing was impossible many times, and that it would have zero benefits for anyone. Yet several mods and custom clients use this technique already with hundreds of thousands of users.

- "It's easy to tear down someone else's ship, but very hard to build and successfully sail your own."
