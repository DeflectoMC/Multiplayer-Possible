# Multiplayer-Possible
A simple demonstration program on doing LAN outside of LAN.

Maven/Gradle files have not been added yet; I've compiled this directly in my IDE.

You are free to use this as a reference for how to accomplish this technique on your own.

I will be adding Wiki pages tomorrow, more tutorial videos, etc.

For now, you can find the simplest possible example (50 lines of code) in the file named SimplerExample.java.

This code is licensed under Apache 2.0 Commons License, but honestly with how short it is, you could probably just copy the *idea* instead of the code; and then you wouldn't have to include a copy of the license would you ðŸ˜‰




### Demo on YouTube

Potentially Huge Benefits:

- Base free servers for everyone

- Less electricity usage ðŸ’šðŸŒŽ due to less computers required for multiplayer, and less packets sent over the internet

- Could be turned into a Fabric mod + Bukkit plugin, automated with a full blown /join command etc. That is my current plan. I did it with my previous project using WebRTC, called GameBridge.


- Could be turned into a free server hosting network, by adding a lot more features and making it so players don't have to manually enter the info every time
