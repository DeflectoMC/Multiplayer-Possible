## Works with:

- Vanilla unmodded Minecraft (Java and Bedrock, all versions)
- Most wifi setups
- LAN worlds
- Servers with and without mods/plugins
- Bedrock players on Java servers using [Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser)
- Games and programs other than Minecraft*

*If they allow you to host your own independent server.

## Benefits

Puts control in server owners' hands:

- You aren't required to buy anything
- You choose how much RAM your server gets
- You choose your max player count
- You retain control over your server's files
- Potentially 24/7 - no uptime restrictions
- You can always join your own server, even when you don't have internet

Improves player experiences:

- On good internet, players' ping will decrease due to a faster protocol
- In the future, players will be able to join a server in any world via an in-game command
- The same technology could be used for voice chat without requiring servers to install it

Helps out small groups of friends

- You don't have to join a public server with troublesome players just to play with your friend
- You can create a LAN world and let your friend join


ðŸ’šðŸŒŽ Better for the Environment ðŸŒŽðŸ’š
- When you play and host on the same computer, you don't use the internet for that connection.
- Reusing the same computer to join and host at the same time means one less computer has to be running electricity.

You can join a server you're running on your computer via 127.0.0.1 or "localhost" as the server IP.
