# Multiplayer-Possible
A simple demonstration program on doing LAN outside of LAN.

Maven/Gradle files have not been added yet; I've compiled this directly in my IDE.

You are free to use this as a reference for how to accomplish this technique on your own.

I will be adding Wiki pages tomorrow, more tutorial videos, etc.

For now, you can find the simplest possible example (50 lines of code) in the file named SimplerExample.java.



### Demo on YouTube
